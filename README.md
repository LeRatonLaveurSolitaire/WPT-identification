# Wireless Power Transfer system identification techniques

This repository regroup the source code of simulation of a research project on WPT system
The goal is to estimate parameters of a WPT system in real time using the following procedure :

* Inject white noise to stimulate the system at every frequency
* Exctract the impulse response of the system 
* Estimate parameters from the impulse response

Documentation is made with docstring using the google format.
